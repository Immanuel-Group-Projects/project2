Jorge Anzaldo's fork of Project 2 for ITMD-362


Including changes already made that weren't a part of this fork, I'm working on:

additional Javascript for the contact page - In the form of an alert when sending the form

making sure whitespace is consistent - done

replacing details tag with a working accordion in events page - done

editing media tags to make website more readable on smaller screens
